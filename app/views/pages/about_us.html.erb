    <p>
      The Noble Quran is the central religious text of Islam. Muslims believe the Qurâ€™an is the book of Divine guidance
      and direction for mankind, and consider the original Arabic text the final revelation of Allah (God). All
      translations of the original Arabic text are thus interpretations of the original meanings and should be embraced
      as such.

    <h1>Meccan Surahs</h1>
    <p>
      The Meccan suras are the chronologically earlier chapters (suras) of the Quran that were, according to Islamic
      tradition, revealed anytime before the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammed and his followers from Mecca to
      Medina (Hijra). The Medinan suras are those revelations that occurred after the move to the city of that name.
    </p>

    <h1>Medinan Surahs</h1>
    <p>
      The Medinan suras or Medinan chapters of the Quran are the latest 24 suras that, according to Islamic tradition,
      were revealed at Medina after Muhammad's hijra from Mecca. These suras were revealed by Allah when the Muslim
      community was larger and more developed, as opposed to their minority position in Mecca.

      We have redesigned the website with a user friendly approach in mind. To browse through the surahs, click on the
      button (shown left) in the READ & LISTEN page and navigate surah by title or by page. In future iterations, we
      will be integrating more search and audio features inshaAllah. If you have any suggestions on how we can make the
      website a better experience please do not hesitate to
